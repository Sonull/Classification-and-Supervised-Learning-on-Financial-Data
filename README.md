# Objective of the Analysis
* Predicting whether the S&P 500 Index would have a gain for two days in a row using Classification and Supervised Learning 

# Dependent Variable

* The variable ’target’ is the dependent variable
* It takes the value ‘Yes’ if the S&P 500 index had a gain for two days in a row and ‘No’ otherwise

# Independent Variables
