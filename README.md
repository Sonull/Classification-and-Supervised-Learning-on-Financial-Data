# Objective of the Analysis
* Predicting whether the S&P 500 Index would have a gain for two days in a row using Classification and Supervised Learning 

# Overview of the steps involved


# Dependent Variable

* The variable ’target’ is the dependent variable
* It takes the value ‘Yes’ if the S&P 500 index had a gain for two days in a row and ‘No’ otherwise


# Independent Variables for Clustering and Model Building



# Feature Engineering

# Data Preparation



# Decision Tree

# Random Forest
