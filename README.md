# Objective of the Analysis
* Predicting whether the S&P 500 Index would have a gain for two days in a row using Classification and Supervised Learning 

# Dependent Variable

* The variable ’target’ is the dependent variable
* It takes the value ‘Yes’ if the S&P 500 index had a gain for two days in a row and ‘No’ otherwise

# Independent Variables

* The difference between the High and Low Price of the Stock is lowest on Wednesday
* The difference between High and Low price is more than 100$ usually on a Monday and Thursday

* The difference between Close Price and Open Price is more spread out during the first month and the last month
* The trading activities seem to be affected by seasonality
* The fluctuations are the lowest in Quarter 3. Here Quarter 3 is the period from month 7 through 9

* The Percentage difference between the High Price and the Open Price is the highest during the months 1 and 12
* Usually, the percentage difference between the High Price and Open price is less than 5%, for any month
* For the month 1, the high price of a day went up as high as 10% from the open price

* The distribution of the difference between the High Price and Low Price is majorly concentrated around 15$ for years 1 and 2
* This difference is seen to be getting more spread out across the years, that is the variability has been seen to increase down the years
* For a majority of the years, the difference seems to be concentrated around 25$. This means usually, the value of the high price is not more than 25$ than low price throughout the year
* This chart basically tells us that the stock market is very volatile and each year the difference between High Price and Low Price fluctuates a lot

* The Percentage difference between Open Price and Low price has been the lowest for month 12, with the low price being even less than 7.5% than the Open Price
* Usually the Percentage of difference between the Open Price and Low Price is within 5%

 * There exists a positive linear relationship between the Low Price of the stock and the Close Price of the stock
 * As the Low Price increases the Close Price is expected to increase
 * This is evidenced by the overall data as well as the data for each year
